# Dungeons and Dragons 5e Monster List and Encounter Difficulty Calculator

## Overview
Welcome to my project! The goal of this project was to create a single page application that leverages an open API; in this case http://www.dnd5eapi.co/. The intent of the project is to provide a searchable, filterable, quick reference for the standard monsters in DnD 5e to aid in encounter creation/balancing. 

## How to Use
To use this application, clone the repo/download the zip file. Once complete, simply open the index.html file and it should be ready to go.

## Features
Once opened, the application should populate a card for each monster with some of their relevant stats.

### Monster Card Filtering
These cards can be:
* Searched by name with a key word
* Filtered alphabetically
* Added to a favorites list to be viewed later

### Encounter Builder
The encounter builder allows you to choose a party's size and set their levels. You can also add any monsters you wish to the encounter and specify the quantity of each. Once ready, you can click the "Calculate" button to see the projected difficulty of the encounter
